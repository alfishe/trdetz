* read/write group of sectors from/to image
* read/write binary file (including 'hobeta' files) to/from image
* delete/undelete file from image
* change file attributes (name, start adress, etc...)
* get TRD catalogue or single file info
* get disk summary info
* pack disk space (i.e. TR-DOS 'move' command)
